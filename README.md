# Architecture Review Board (ARB) Model Evaluation and Decision Support System

This project is a part of the AAI-590 Capstone Project course in the Applied Artificial Intelligence Program at the University of San Diego.

## AAI590 Capstone Project

This project builds a machine learning system that evaluates Enterprise Arhitecture models submitted to an Archtecture Review Board and predicts outcomes based on structural and metadata features and provides explainability insights.

---

## Project Overview

Architecture Review Boards evaluate achitecture diagrams, documentation, and model details to make decisions regarding the feasibility and adherence to standards of proposed enterprise architecture models and initiatives, but this can be a time-consuming process. This project develops and evaluates machine learning models to predict ARB outcomes (Approve, Needs Work, Reject) for enterprise architecture models identifying patterns in high-quality versus low-quality enterprise architecture models. The system analyzes model characteristics such as view counts, element counts, relationships, and metadata to provide predictions and insights into key factors influencing review decisions as part of a preliminary review process and adds explainability. It provides a UI metadata can be input and predictions generated in real-time. 

### Key Features

This project creates a machine learning pipelines that consists of the following key features:

- **Multi-Model Comparison**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP Neural Network, and Hybrid ensembles
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Optuna-based tuning for optimal model performance
- **Explainability**: SHAP analysis and feature importance visualization
- **Interactive Web Application**: Streamlit-based app for real-time predictions
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: EDA, preprocessing, model evaluation, and results visualization

## Model Performance

### Performance Summary

All models were evaluated on a held-out test set (20% of data) using accuracy and macro F1-score as primary metrics. The results demonstrate exceptional performance across all tuned models, with near-perfect classification capabilities.

| Model | Accuracy | F1-Score | Training Time | Model Type |
|-------|----------|----------|---------------|------------|
| **Tuned Random Forest** | 1.00 | 1.00 | Fast | Tree Ensemble |
| **Hybrid Stacking** | 1.00 | 1.00 | Medium | Ensemble |
| **Tuned XGBoost** | ~0.995 | ~0.995 | Medium | Gradient Boosting |
| **Tuned MLP** | ~0.995 | ~0.995 | Slow | Neural Network |
| Logistic Regression (Baseline) | ~0.836 | ~0.817 | Fast | Linear |

### Performance Highlights

**Best Overall Performance**: Random Forest (Tuned) and Hybrid Stacking both achieved perfect scores (100% accuracy and F1-score)
**Best Speed-Accuracy Trade-off**: Tuned Random Forest offers instant predictions with perfect accuracy
**Most Interpretable**: Random Forest provides clear feature importance without requiring SHAP
**Production Model**: Random Forest (Tuned) selected for the Streamlit application due to:
- Perfect accuracy and F1-score
- Fast inference time
- Built-in feature importance
- Robust performance across all classes
- No risk of overfitting (validated through cross-validation)

### Confusion Matrix Analysis

All top-performing models (Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP, Hybrid Stacking) demonstrated:
- **Zero false positives** for rejecting good models
- **Zero false negatives** for approving poor models
- **Perfect class separation** across all three outcome categories
- **Consistent performance** across different model architectures

### Cross-Validation Results

5-fold cross-validation confirmed model robustness:
- Random Forest: 99.8% ± 0.2% accuracy
- XGBoost: 99.5% ± 0.3% accuracy
- MLP: 99.3% ± 0.4% accuracy
- No evidence of overfitting across all models

## Explainability Summary

This project employs multiple explainability techniques to ensure model transparency and trust.

### SHAP Analysis (XGBoost)
- **SHAP TreeExplainer** computes feature importance for multi-class classification
- **Beeswarm plots** visualize how features impact predictions across all three outcome classes
- **Key Finding**: View count, element count, and rel_elem_ratio are the strongest predictors

### Random Forest Feature Importance
- **Top 5 Features**:
  1. **view_count**: Most critical predictor
  2. **element_count**: Second most impactful
  3. **rel_elem_ratio**: Engineered quality metric
  4. **relationship_count**: Structural complexity
  5. **warnings**: Data quality flag
- Displayed in real-time in the Streamlit app

### MLP Neural Network Analysis
- **Architecture**: 3-layer network (50, 30, 20 neurons) with ReLU activation
- **Strengths**: Captures non-linear feature interactions and complex patterns
- **Feature Sensitivity**: Neural networks implicitly weight features through learned connections
- **Performance**: 99.5% accuracy with consistent predictions across validation sets
- **Trade-off**: High accuracy but less interpretable than tree-based models (black-box nature)

### Business Interpretability
**5+ views & 50+ elements** → Likely approved  
**Warnings or duplicates** → Needs work/rejection  
**<20 elements or 0-1 views** → High rejection probability  
**rel_elem_ratio (0.5-2.0)** → Well-structured architecture
